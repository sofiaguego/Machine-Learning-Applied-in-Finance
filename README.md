# Neural Network Model - Loan Approval

This repository contains a neural network model designed to predict loan approval decisions based on various applicant information. The model is built using scikit-learn's MLPClassifier.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset that includes the following features:

- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Gender (Female, Male)
- Married (No, Yes)
- Dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)
- Education (Graduate, Not Graduate)
- Self_Employed (No, Yes)
- Property_Area (Rural, Semiurban, Urban)

The target variable is "Loan_Status," which can take on two values: "Approved" or "Not Approved."

Based on the client's provided information, the model will assess whether the client is eligible for loan approval or not.
