# NEURAL NETWORK MODELS:

# 1. First Model: Loan Approval

This repository contains a neural network model to predict loan approval decisions based on various applicant information. The model is built using Sci-kit-learn's MLPClassifier.

Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset that includes the following features:

- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Gender (Female, Male)
- Married (No, Yes)
- Dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)
- Education (Graduate, Not Graduate)
- Self_Employed (No, Yes)
- Property_Area (Rural, Semiurban, Urban)

The target variable is "Loan_Status," which can take on two values: "Approved" or "Not Approved."

Based on the client's provided information, the model will assess whether the client is eligible for loan approval or not.


# 2. Second Model: Customer Churn

This Jupyter notebook contains a Neural Network to predict if a new customer is most likely to stay at the bank as a customer or not! Features Included:

-CreditScore        
-Age                
-Tenure             
-Balance            
-NumOfProducts      
-HasCrCard          
-IsActiveMember     
-EstimatedSalary    
-Exited             
-Gender_Female      
-Gender_Male 

The target variable is "Exited" which can take on two values: 1 or 0 (1= Customer stays, 0= Customer Does not stay). After completing the model, a new prediction needs to be tested using information from a new client. The model will provide an output either if it would stay or not given the customer's information and current situation.
